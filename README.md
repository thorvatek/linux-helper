# Thor's Linux Helper 🛠️  

**A Fedora-focused automation tool for streamlined system setup, gaming, and production environments.**  
Simplify package installation, system configuration, and utility setup with a single script.  

---

## 🌟 Features  

- **One-Click Setup**: Install essential packages, development tools, and gaming utilities.  
- **Gaming Ready**: Preconfigure Steam, Proton, Lutris, and WINE for Linux gaming.  
- **Production Environment**: Set up development tools (e.g., Docker, Python, Node.js) and IDE integrations.  
- **System Tweaks**: Apply performance optimizations, theme adjustments, and kernel tweaks.  
- **Safety First**: Runs with `sudo` but avoids irreversible system changes unless explicitly confirmed.
